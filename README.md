# LampeTorche
===========

#### The goal of this Android application is to provide a simple flashlight for Android devices and no more.
<ul>

  <li>If the divice has a camera with a flash you can use it as a flashlight . Simply push the toggle button "Flash off".
  Once activated the flash will remain on until you push again the toggle button "Flash on". So you can navigate to other 
  application with the flash on.</li><br>
  
  <li>If the device as no flash you can use the screen button, a white screen at max brightness will be dispalyed. Less light
  than camera flash but still useful at short distance.</li><br>
  
  <li>An original extra feature is implemented : a light morse displaying SOS.
  If both flash and screen are activated and mode SOS is on, flash and screen are synchronized.</li>
</ul>

  <ul>
    <li> English, default</li>
    <li>Chinese (simplified)</li>
    <li> French</li>

### Installation

####System requirement

<li>Feature : Flash, not mandatory.</li>
</ul>

This permission and this feature are mandatory to access the camera flash, but only the flash is used, neither photos nor 
movies are taken.

It seems to work on the latest Lollipop version code dispite the fact that the camera api used is deprecated at this 
Lollipop api level (21) and replaced by camera2 api. Only tested on emulator.

Enjoy !

The prefered installation location is SD card.
